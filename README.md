# OpenGL

This repository is where i will record my progress in learning the OpenGL API. The end goal is to have a library of functions/classes that I, or anyone can use for building games or apps using OpenGL.

# Usage

## Windows:

 - Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/insomniac206/OpenGL.git`
 - Open the solution `OpenGL.sln` that is located in the root directory

Cmake support hasn't been added yet.
